# Usage Demo Guide Artifacts

This folder contains sample files that are referenced in the Demo Usage Guide from previous versions of the Guardian. As of version 1.0.5 the following files will not be needed to follow the guide:

1. Sample Schema for iRec Policy (`iRec_Application_Details.zip`)
2. Sample Policy Workflow configuration file (`irec-policy-config.txt`)
3. Sample of Verra REDD Policy (`Verra REDD.zip`)
4. Sample Schema design template for Verra REDD Policy (`REDD APD Schema Design Template.xlsx`)

We are keeping them in the repo as they may be relevant in future releases.

## Demo Usage Guide

1. The Guardian reference implementation comes with two predefined users:

-   **Root Authority**: A standard registry, or a Root Authority in our scenario, is an organization that establishes science-based standards for measuring, reporting, and verifying (MRV) ecological benefit claims and issues value in the form of credit for claims that meet the standard set. A standard registry also authorizes validation and verification bodies (VVBs) to collect and process claims based on the established standard. The creation of scientific-based standards for MRV is a rigorous discipline that requires independence from commercial influence in the pursuit of accurate accounting of benefit or emissions claims. A standard registry organization can also maintain a central registry of credits they have issued that can be sold directly via the registry itself or established as reference value on networks, exchanges, or marketplaces.
-   **Auditor**: This is a 3rd part who will need to view/audit the entire chain of events; from the establishment of the science-based standards through creation of the credit.
